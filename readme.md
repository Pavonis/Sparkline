## Sparkline ##

Sparkline is a lightweight view-controller designed for simple data representation. Sparkline is based of 
the fantastic work of [Edward Tufte](http://edwardtufte.com) and his book *[The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)*.
Sparkline provides clean visualisation of univariate datasets, and is intelligently designed
to produce great-looking graphical displays by default, with customisable attributes available
to fine-tine the output to a specific need.

## Getting Started ##

Sparkline is currently a work in progress. Please check back later, or fork and contribute.
